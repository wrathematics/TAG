\begin{block}{Background}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Humanities and social sciences historically dominated by qualitative 
methods.
  \item Researchers in these fields increasingly turning to quantitative methods 
and computational resources to answer larger questions.
  \item Still much resistance, often driven by a ``technological 
familiarity gap''.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.8cm}

So why expect users to start with this?

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::content_transformer(base::tolower))
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removePunctuation)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removeNumbers)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::stripWhitespace)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removeWords, 
    tm::stopwords(input$data_filter_stopwords_lang))
tdm <- tm::TermDocumentMatrix(corpus)
wordcount_table <- sort(rowSums(as.matrix(tdm)), decreasing = TRUE)
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{.8cm}

Programming is great!  But...
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users often lack the background and have little access to training.
  \item No institutional rewards for developing technical skills.
  \item Programming vs GUI:  Recall vs. recognition.
\end{itemize}

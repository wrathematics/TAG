## Dispersion

The dispersion, or lexical dispersion, plots visually display the
frequency of occurrence of a term in a text.

For example, if we have loaded the *Alice in Wonderland* corpus,
we might use the words list: `alice,cat,hare`.  This will show
the lexical dispersion for the words 'alice', 'cat', and 'hare'
in *Alice in Wonderland*.
